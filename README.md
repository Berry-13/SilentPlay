# Silent Play ðŸ¤«

Silent Play is a simple yet powerful shortcut that enhances your mobile gaming experience by disabling Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity in such a way that the school cannot see what you are doing. With the rise of mobile gaming, it's become increasingly important to have a distraction-free environment to fully immerse yourself in the game. However, notifications and alerts from other apps or school can easily disrupt your gameplay and ruin your concentration. 

Silent Play solves this problem by automatically disabling Bluetooth and Wi-Fi when you launch your favorite game. This ensures that you won't be interrupted by incoming calls, messages, or notifications while you're playing. The app is easy to use and can be customized to suit your preferences.
